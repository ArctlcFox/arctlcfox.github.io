Hey!
I'm ArcticFox. 

I'm a teenage developer who has being trying to learn to code since 2016.
For a really long time, I have being fascinated with technology and how 
it all works.

At the start of the year I did a coding project for the first time in 
almost two years, and really enjoyed it. That project was a site about 
the show Futurama, I made it using HTML and CSS.

After making that site, I decided I wanted to do more with code and 
started to learn JavaScript. 

I made this website to try include all the three languages I've learnt 
into something all together.
